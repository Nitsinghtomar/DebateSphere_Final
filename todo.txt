DONE -> save the state of the debate arena (changing tab does not lead to resetting of the debate)
-> have a finish button (record the conversation)
-> find fallacies in debates (if any) - have a predefined set of fallacies it is built to find (ai coach)
-> suggest improvements (predefined set of improvements? like better vocabulary, tone, errs uhms etc.)
-> metrics in analytics (argument strength, vocabulary, erruhms, fluency, 


have another endpoint which takes in the audioBlob and stores it temporarily in a blob list of sorts, then after debate is finished, combine the blobs into a single blob and send it to gemini to analyse. can this be done?

have another table in mongodb called debate id, which stores the transcripts as well as audio chunks (if possible), as well as the analysis id

then have another table called analysis id, which stores the analysis of a debate, like argument strength, vocabulary, err uhms count, fluency, etc. -> in some specific json format


⚡ Quick Win Approach (MVP)

If you want to get something working fast:

Phase 1 (Backend):

    Add fallacies field to Analysis model

    Update Gemini prompt

Phase 2 (Frontend):

    Create basic Analytics tab

    Fetch last 20 analyses from existing API

    Display 2-3 simple charts using Recharts

Phase 3 (Optional Later):

    Add UserMetrics optimization

    Add advanced filters & insights



Week 1: Backend Foundation
✅ Day 1-2: Update Analysis.js model with fallacies field
✅ Day 3-4: Update Gemini prompt to detect fallacies
✅ Day 5: Test fallacy detection with sample debates

Week 2: Metrics Tracking
✅ Day 1-2: Create UserMetrics.js model
✅ Day 3-4: Create metrics routes & update logic
✅ Day 5: Test metrics extraction & storage

Week 3: Frontend - Analytics Tab
✅ Day 1-2: Create AnalyticsView component skeleton
✅ Day 3-4: Implement charts (Recharts integration)
✅ Day 5: Add improvement indicators & styling

Week 4: Polish & Testing
✅ Day 1-2: Test with real debate data
✅ Day 3-4: UI/UX improvements
✅ Day 5: Final integration & bug fixes

📋 FINAL IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE
Phase 1: Backend Foundation

    Create Analysis model (MongoDB schema)

    Update Debate model (add analysisId, analysisStatus fields)

    Create POST /api/debate/finish endpoint

    Create background job function for Gemini processing

    Create GET /api/analysis/:debateId/status endpoint

    Create GET /api/analysis/:analysisId endpoint

Phase 2: Frontend - Finish Debate

    Add audioRecordings array to debateState

    Modify mic recording to save blobs to array

    Add "Finish Debate" button in DebateArena

    Implement client-side audio blob combining

    Create finish debate handler (POST to /api/debate/finish)

    Show success toast and navigate to AI Coach tab

Phase 3: Frontend - AI Coach Tab

    Create "AI Coach" navigation tab

    Create GET /api/debates/user/:userId endpoint (list debates)

    Build debates list UI with cards

    Implement status display logic (Generating vs Show Analysis)

    Add refresh button with status check

    Implement notification system for completed analyses

Phase 4: Frontend - Analysis View

    Build analysis results page/component

    Implement overall score display (big number)

    Add radar/spider chart (5 metrics)

    Create tabbed sections for detailed metrics

    Build enhanced transcript viewer (highlight disfluencies)

    Add navigation from debate list to analysis view

Phase 5: Polish

    Error handling and retry logic

    Loading states and spinners

    Toast notifications polish

    Cleanup debateState after finish

    Testing and bug fixes
